## üß† ./notes

This repository is like my learning journal.

I'm not an expert. It's not an official course. I just documented what I learned.

I might add more in the future if I get even more advanced with PHP.

## üåü ./support

If it was helpful or you liked it, please leave a star.
That motivates me more than a cup of coffee ‚òï‚ú®

## üõ∏ ./author

**Author:** `jeanctech`,
**Style:** `terminal vibes`, functional documentation, no fear of code.
